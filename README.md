# WalkHealthy

Walk Healthy will be an app for college students to track steps and routes around campus. 
It will help students meet other students interested in walking for health, compare their performance,
and plan group walks.

The Walk Healthy mission is an application that will help in creating social connections between like-minded
customers by helping customers find groups with similar fitness skill level and availability to walk more.
To aid in helping customers walk more, Walk Healthy will also provide a way for customers to track how much
they have accomplished.

Walk Healthy will help in creating meaningful and lasting relationships through the camaraderie of customers
bettering their physical health. To do this, Walk Healthy will let customers search and filter local walking
groups, create groups to invite others to join, and accurately track a customer's movement.

In a world of increasing technology, obesity, and decreasing social interactions, Walk Healthy wants to
use technology to change that and bring people back together to motivate each other better their health and
strengthen the community. By producing this application, Walk Healthy will show Saison's abilities to produce
a great job.
